Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a Ski School application, which allows users to view and register for various ski courses. The application consists of a frontend and backend.

Main Components:
1. Frontend: The frontend is developed using Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. It includes multiple components, services, and models to handle different aspects of the application, such as displaying the list of courses, registering for a course, displaying course details, and managing user courses.

2. Backend: The backend is developed using Spring Boot, a Java framework for building enterprise applications. It includes multiple classes to handle database operations, business logic, and RESTful API endpoints. The backend manages the storage and retrieval of course and user data, as well as the course registration process.

Suggestions for Missing Items:
Based on the given files, it appears that the project is missing the following components:
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms: There are no files or services related to user authentication and authorization. It is recommended to implement authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the application and its resources.
