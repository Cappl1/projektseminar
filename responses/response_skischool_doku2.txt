Overview:

The goal of this project is to create a web application for a skiing school. The application allows users to view and register for available ski courses. The frontend of the application is implemented using Angular, while the backend is implemented using Spring Boot and Java. The frontend provides various components for displaying course details, registering for courses, and managing user courses. The backend provides RESTful APIs for retrieving and manipulating course, member, and registration data.

- models: This directory contains the interfaces for the Course and User data models.
- register: This component is responsible for registering a user for a specific course.
- services: This directory contains the Angular services for fetching course and user data.
- unregister: This component allows a user to unregister from a course.
- user-courses: This component displays the courses that a user has registered for.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Add error handling: It would be beneficial to add error handling in both the frontend and backend to handle potential errors during API requests and display relevant error messages to the user.

2. Add authentication and authorization: Currently, the application does not have any authentication or authorization mechanisms. Adding user authentication and authorization can provide better security and control over user access to certain resources.

3. Implement search and filtering: It would be useful to implement search and filtering functionality in the frontend to allow users to search for courses based on specific criteria, such as location or duration.

4. Add pagination: If the number of courses or user registrations becomes large, implementing pagination in the backend and frontend can improve performance and user experience.

5. Improve error handling and validation: The current implementation does not handle validation errors or provide meaningful error messages to the user. Adding input validation and improving error handling can enhance the user experience.

6. Add tests: Although some unit tests are already provided, adding more test coverage for all components, services, and backend logic can help ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.

7. Improve code organization: In the frontend, consider reorganizing the code into separate directories for components, services, models, etc., to follow a more modular structure. In the backend, consider separating domain, logic, and service classes into separate packages for better organization and maintainability.

Overall, the project provides a basic implementation of a skiing school web application. With the suggested improvements, it can become a more robust and user-friendly application.
